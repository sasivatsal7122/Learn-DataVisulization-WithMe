For multimodal distributions (those with multiple peaks) this can be particularly limiting.Unlike a box plot that can only show summary statistics, violin plots depict summary statistics and the density of each variable.Sometimes the median and mean aren't enough to understand a dataset.kernel density estimation to show the distribution shape of the data.
